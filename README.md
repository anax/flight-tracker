# Maldives Airports Company Limited (MACL) Flight Tracking Mobile Application

## Overview
This project involves the design and development of a mobile application interface for Maldives Airports Company Limited (MACL) that provides real-time flight tracking, gate information, and baggage claim updates. The application is designed to be intuitive, accessible, and visually appealing, symbolizing the beauty and tourism inspirations of the Maldives.

## Features
- **Flight Tracking**: Display dynamic flight details including flight number, destination, departure time, gate number, baggage claim info, and flight status (On-time, Delayed, Cancelled, Boarding).
- **Light & Dark Mode Toggle**: Implement a theme switcher using a state management library to ensure UI consistency in both modes.
- **Search & Filter Functionality**: Allow users to search by flight number or destination and filter flights by status.
- **Accessibility Considerations**: Use ARIA attributes and ensure high contrast and readable fonts for better user experience.

## Tech Stack
- **Design Tools**: Figma for wireframing and UI prototyping.
- **Frontend**: React.js with TailwindCSS for UI components.
- **Dummy API**: Static JSON data stored locally with `setTimeout` to simulate real-time API calls.

## Deliverables
1. **UI/UX Design Presentation**:
   - Prototype & Wireframes
   - Implementation of UI with React.js
   - GitHub Repository with ReadMe Instructions
   - Presentation (30 mins):
     - UI Design Process & Inspiration
     - Color, Typography & Layout Justification
     - Demo of Functional Dashboard
     - Challenges faced & how they were solved

2. **Source Code**: Submit by 2359hrs before Saturday (15th February 2025).
